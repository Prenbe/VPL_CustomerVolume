# VPL Operations Data Analysis

## Mission
The mission of VPL is to deliver excellent products and services that help hospitals and healthcare systems obtain increased visibility and savings in their healthcare supply chain. The VPL operations team has conducted a review of customer shipping volume, specifically focusing on ACME HEALTH. The goal is to understand the changes in ACME HEALTH's shipping volume from Q1 2021 to Q2 2022 and identify opportunities to return the customer to their previous volume.

## Background
ACME HEALTH experienced a change in their FedEx account (from 2002 to 1562) in Q1 2021, which was expected to have no impact on their inbound shipping volume. However, the data suggests a material change in volume, prompting further investigation.
